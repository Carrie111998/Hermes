# Comps Analysis — Notes, Methodology, Quality Checks & Red Flags

## Section 4: Notes & Methodology Documentation

### Required Components

**Data Sources & Quality:**
- Where did the data come from? (S&P Kensho MCP, FactSet MCP, Daloopa MCP, Bloomberg, SEC filings)
- What period does it cover? (Q4 2024, audited figures)
- How was it verified? (Cross-checked against 10-K/10-Q)
- Note: Prioritize MCP data sources (S&P Kensho, FactSet, Daloopa) if available for better accuracy and traceability

**Key Definitions:**
- EBITDA calculation method (Gross Profit + D&A, or Operating Income + D&A)
- Free Cash Flow formula (Operating CF - CapEx)
- Special metrics explained (Rule of 40, FCF Conversion)
- Time period definitions (LTM, CAGR calculation periods)

**Valuation Methodology:**
- How was Enterprise Value calculated? (Market Cap + Net Debt)
- What growth rates were used? (Historical CAGR, forward estimates)
- Any adjustments made? (One-time items excluded, normalized margins)

**Analysis Framework:**
- What's the investment thesis? (Cloud/SaaS efficiency)
- What metrics matter most? (Cash generation, capital efficiency)
- How should readers interpret the statistics? (Quartiles provide context)

## Section 6: Best Practices & Quality Checks

### Before You Start
1. **Define the peer group** - Companies must be truly comparable (similar business model, scale, geography)
2. **Choose the right period** - LTM smooths seasonality; quarterly shows trends
3. **Standardize units upfront** - Millions vs. billions decision affects everything
4. **Map data sources** - Know where each number comes from

### As You Build
1. **Input all raw data first** - Complete the blue text before writing formulas
2. **Add cell comments to ALL hard-coded inputs** - Right-click cell → Insert Comment → Document source OR assumption

   **For sourced data, cite exactly where it came from:**
   - Example: "Bloomberg Terminal - MSFT Equity DES, accessed 2024-10-02"
   - Example: "Q4 2024 10-K filing, page 42, line item 'Total Revenue'"
   - Example: "FactSet consensus estimate as of 2024-10-02"
   - **Include hyperlinks when possible**: Right-click cell → Link → paste URL to SEC filing, data source, or report

   **For assumptions, explain the reasoning:**
   - Example: "Assumed 15% EBITDA margin based on peer median, company does not disclose"
   - Example: "Estimated Enterprise Value as Market Cap + $50M net debt (from Q3 balance sheet, Q4 not yet available)"
   - Example: "Forward P/E based on street consensus EPS of $3.45 (average of 12 analyst estimates)"

   **Why this matters**: Enables audit trails, data verification, assumption transparency, and future updates
3. **Build formulas row by row** - Test each calculation before moving on
4. **Use absolute references for headers** - $C$6 locks the header row
5. **Format consistently** - Percentages as percentages, not decimals
6. **Add conditional formatting** - Highlight outliers automatically

### Sanity Checks
- **Margin test**: Gross margin > EBITDA margin > Net margin (always true by definition)
- **Multiple reasonableness**: 
  - EV/Revenue: typically 0.5-20x (varies widely by industry)
  - EV/EBITDA: typically 8-25x (fairly consistent across industries)
  - P/E: typically 10-50x (depends on growth rate)
- **Growth-multiple correlation**: Higher growth usually means higher multiples
- **Size-efficiency trade-off**: Larger companies often have better margins (scale benefits)

### Common Mistakes to Avoid
❌ Mixing market cap and enterprise value in formulas
❌ Using different time periods for numerator and denominator (LTM vs quarterly)
❌ Hardcoding numbers into formulas instead of cell references
❌ **Hard-coded inputs without cell comments citing the source OR explaining the assumption**
❌ Missing hyperlinks to SEC filings or data sources when available
❌ Including too many metrics without clear purpose
❌ Including non-comparable companies (different business models)
❌ Using outdated data without disclosure
❌ Calculating averages of percentages incorrectly (should be median)

## Section 10: Red Flags & Warning Signs

### Data Quality Issues
🚩 Inconsistent time periods (mixing quarterly and annual)  
🚩 Missing data without explanation  
🚩 Significant differences between data sources (>10% variance)

### Valuation Red Flags
🚩 Negative EBITDA companies being valued on EBITDA multiples (use revenue multiples instead)  
🚩 P/E ratios >100x without hypergrowth story  
🚩 Margins that don't make sense for the industry

### Comparability Issues
🚩 Different fiscal year ends (causes timing problems)  
🚩ixing pure-play and conglomerates  
🚩 Materially different business models labeled as "comps"

**When in doubt, exclude the company.** Better to have 3 perfect comps than 6 questionable ones.

## Output Checklist

Before delivering a comp analysis, verify:
- [ ] All companies are truly comparable
- [ ] Data is from consistent time periods
- [ ] Units are clearly labeled (millions/billions)
- [ ] Formulas reference cells, not hardcoded values
- [ ] **All hard-coded input cells have comments with either: (1) exact data source with citation, OR (2) clear assumption with explanation**
- [ ] **Hyperlinks added where relevant** (SEC EDGAR filings, Bloomberg pages, research reports)
- [ ] Statistics include at least 5 metrics (Max, 75th, Med, 25th, Min)
- [ ] Notes section documents sources and methodology
- [ ] Visual formatting follows conventions (blue = input, black = formula)
- [ ] Sanity checks pass (margins logical, multiples reasonable)
- [ ] Date stamp is current ("As of [Date]")
- [ ] Formula auditing shows no errors (#DIV/0!, #REF!, #N/A)

## Continuous Improvement

After completing a comp analysis, ask:
1. Did the statistics reveal unexpected insights?
2. Were there any data gaps that limited analysis?
3. Did stakeholders ask for metrics you didn't include?
4. How long did it take vs. how long should it take?
5. What would make this more useful next time?

The best comp analyses evolve with each iteration. Save templates, learn from feedback, and refine the structure based on what decision-makers actually use.
