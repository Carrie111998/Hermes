# Model Validation, Audit & Scenario Checks Reference

## Model Validation and Audit

This section consolidates all validation checks and audit procedures for completed templates.

## Scenario Analysis (Base / Upside / Downside)

Use a scenario toggle (dropdown) in the Assumptions tab with CHOOSE or INDEX/MATCH formulas.

| Scenario | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Base Case | Management guidance or consensus estimates |
| Upside Case | Above-guidance growth, margin expansion |
| Downside Case | Below-trend growth, margin compression |

**Key Drivers to Sensitize**: Revenue growth, Gross margin, SG&A %, DSO/DIO/DPO, CapEx %, Interest rate, Tax rate.

**Scenario Audit Checks**: Toggle switches all statements, BS balances in all scenarios, Cash ties out, Hierarchy holds (Upside > Base > Downside for NI, EBITDA, FCF, margins).

### Check Categories

**Section 1: Currency Consistency**
- Currency identified and documented in Assumptions
- All tabs use consistent currency symbol and scale
- Units row matches model currency

**Section 2: Balance Sheet Integrity**
- Assets = Liabilities + Equity (for each period)
- Formula: Assets - Liabilities - Equity (must = 0)

**Section 3: Cash Flow Integrity**
- Cash ties to BS (CF Ending Cash = BS Cash)
- Cash Monthly vs Annual: Closing Cash (Monthly) = Closing Cash (Annual)
- NI ties to IS (CF Net Income = IS Net Income)
- D&A ties to schedule
- SBC ties to IS
- ΔAR, ΔInventory, ΔAP tie to WC schedule
- CapEx ties to DA schedule

**Section 4: Retained Earnings**
- RE roll-forward check: Prior RE + NI + SBC - Dividends = Ending RE
- Show component breakdown for debugging

**Section 5: Working Capital**
- AR, Inventory, AP tie to BS
- DSO, DIO, DPO reasonability checks (flag if outside normal ranges)

**Section 6: Debt Schedule**
- Total Debt ties to BS (Current + LT Debt)
- Interest calculation ties to IS

**Section 6b: Equity Financing**
- Equity issuance proceeds tie to BS Common Stock/APIC increase
- Cash increase from equity = Equity account increase (must balance)
- Equity Raise Tie-Out: ΔCommon Stock/APIC (BS) = Equity Issuance (CFF) (must = 0)
- Year 0 Equity Tie-Out: Equity Raised (Year 0) = Beginning Equity Capital (Year 1)

**Section 6c: NOL Schedule**
- Beginning NOL (Year 1 / Formation) = 0 (new business starts with zero NOL)
- NOL increases only when EBT < 0 (losses must be realized to generate NOL)
- DTA ties to BS (NOL Schedule DTA = BS Deferred Tax Asset)
- NOL utilization ≤ 80% of EBT (post-2017 federal limitation)
- NOL balance is non-negative (cannot utilize more than available)
- NOL generated only when EBT < 0
- Tax expense = 0 when taxable income ≤ 0

**Section 7: Scenario Hierarchy**
- Absolute metrics: Upside > Base > Downside (NI, EBITDA, FCF)
- Margins: Upside > Base > Downside (GM%, EBITDA%, NI%)
- Credit metrics: Upside < Base < Downside for leverage (inverted)

**Section 8: Formula Integrity**
- COGS, S&M, G&A, R&D, SBC driven by % of Revenue (no hardcodes)
- Consistent formulas across projection years
- No #REF!, #DIV/0!, #VALUE! errors

**Section 9: Credit Metric Thresholds**
- Flag metrics as Green/Yellow/Red based on covenant thresholds
- Summary of any red flags

### Master Check Formula

Aggregate all section statuses into a single master check:
- If all sections pass → "✓ ALL CHECKS PASS"
- If any section fails → "✗ ERRORS DETECTED - REVIEW BELOW"

### Quick Debug Workflow

When Master Status shows errors:
1. Scroll to find red-highlighted sections
2. Identify which check category has failures
3. Navigate to source tab to investigate
4. Fix the underlying issue
5. Return to Checks tab to verify resolution
