# DCF Workflow Steps 6-7 — Cost of Capital (WACC) and Discounting

### Step 6: Cost of Capital (WACC) Research

**CAPM Methodology for Cost of Equity:**

```
Cost of Equity = Risk-Free Rate + Beta × Equity Risk Premium

Where:
- Risk-Free Rate = Current 10-Year Treasury Yield
- Beta = 5-year monthly stock beta vs market index
- Equity Risk Premium = 5.0-6.0% (market standard)
```

**Cost of Debt Calculation:**

```
After-Tax Cost of Debt = Pre-Tax Cost of Debt × (1 - Tax Rate)

Determine Pre-Tax Cost of Debt from:
- Credit rating (if available)
- Current yield on company bonds
- Interest expense / Total Debt from financials
```

**Capital Structure Weights:**

```
Market Value Equity = Current Stock Price × Shares Outstanding
Net Debt = Total Debt - Cash & Equivalents
Enterprise Value = Market Cap + Net Debt

Equity Weight = Market Cap / Enterprise Value
Debt Weight = Net Debt / Enterprise Value

WACC = (Cost of Equity × Equity Weight) + (After-Tax Cost of Debt × Debt Weight)
```

**Special Cases:**
- **Net Cash Position**: If Cash > Debt, Net Debt is NEGATIVE
  - Debt Weight may be negative
  - WACC calculation adjusts accordingly
- **No Debt**: WACC = Cost of Equity

**Typical WACC Ranges:**
- Large Cap, Stable: 7-9%
- Growth Companies: 9-12%
- High Growth/Risk: 12-15%

### Step 7: Discount Rate Application (5-10 Year Forecast)

**Mid-Year Convention:**
- Cash flows assumed to occur mid-year
- Discount Period: 0.5, 1.5, 2.5, 3.5, 4.5, etc.
- Discount Factor = 1 / (1 + WACC)^Period

**Present Value Calculation:**
```
For each projection year:
PV of FCF = Unlevered FCF × Discount Factor

Example (Year 1):
FCF = $1,000
WACC = 10%
Period = 0.5
Discount Factor = 1 / (1.10)^0.5 = 0.9535
PV = $1,000 × 0.9535 = $954
```

**Projection Period Selection:**
- **5 years**: Standard for most analyses
- **7-10 years**: High growth companies with longer runway
- **3 years**: Mature, stable businesses
