# DCF Workflow Steps 1-5 — Data, History, Revenue, OpEx, FCF

### Step 1: Data Retrieval and Validation

Fetch data from MCP servers, user provided data, and the web.

**Data Sources Priority:**
1. **MCP Servers** (if configured) - Structured financial data from providers like Daloopa
2. **User-Provided Data** - Historical financials from their research
3. **Web Search/Fetch** - Current prices, beta, debt and cash when needed

**Validation Checklist:**
- Verify net debt vs net cash (critical for valuation)
- Confirm diluted shares outstanding (check for recent buybacks/issuances)
- Validate historical margins are consistent with business model
- Cross-check revenue growth rates with industry benchmarks
- Verify tax rate is reasonable (typically 21-28%)

### Step 2: Historical Analysis (3-5 years)

Analyze and document:
- **Revenue growth trends**: Calculate CAGR, identify drivers
- **Margin progression**: Track gross margin, EBIT margin, FCF margin
- **Capital intensity**: D&A and CapEx as % of revenue
- **Working capital efficiency**: NWC changes as % of revenue growth
- **Return metrics**: ROIC, ROE trends

Create summary tables showing:
```
Historical Metrics (LTM):
Revenue: $X million
Revenue growth: X% CAGR
Gross margin: X%
EBIT margin: X%
D&A % of revenue: X%
CapEx % of revenue: X%
FCF margin: X%
```

### Step 3: Build Revenue Projections

**Methodology:**
1. Start with latest actual revenue (LTM or most recent fiscal year)
2. Apply growth rates for each projection year
3. Show both dollar amounts AND calculated growth %

**Growth Rate Framework:**
- Year 1-2: Higher growth reflecting near-term visibility
- Year 3-4: Gradual moderation toward industry average
- Year 5+: Approaching terminal growth rate

**Formula structure:**
- Revenue(Year N) = Revenue(Year N-1) × (1 + Growth Rate)
- Growth %(Year N) = Revenue(Year N) / Revenue(Year N-1) - 1

**Three-scenario approach:**
```
Bear Case: Conservative growth (e.g., 8-12%)
Base Case: Most likely scenario (e.g., 12-16%)
Bull Case: Optimistic growth (e.g., 16-20%)
```

### Step 4: Operating Expense Modeling

**Fixed/Variable Cost Analysis:**

Operating expenses should model realistic operating leverage:
- **Sales & Marketing**: Typically 15-40% of revenue depending on business model
- **Research & Development**: Typically 10-30% for technology companies
- **General & Administrative**: Typically 8-15% of revenue, shows leverage as company scales

**Key principles:**
- ALL percentages based on REVENUE, not gross profit
- Model operating leverage: % should decline as revenue scales
- Maintain separate line items for S&M, R&D, G&A
- Calculate EBIT = Gross Profit - Total OpEx

**Margin expansion framework:**
```
Current State → Target State (Year 5)
Gross Margin: X% → Y% (justify based on scale, efficiency)
EBIT Margin: X% → Y% (result of revenue growth + opex leverage)
```

### Step 5: Free Cash Flow Calculation

**Build FCF in proper sequence:**

```
EBIT
(-) Taxes (EBIT × Tax Rate)
= NOPAT (Net Operating Profit After Tax)
(+) D&A (non-cash expense, % of revenue)
(-) CapEx (% of revenue, typically 4-8%)
(-) Δ NWC (change in working capital)
= Unlevered Free Cash Flow
```

**Working Capital Modeling:**
- Calculate as % of revenue change (delta revenue)
- Typical range: -2% to +2% of revenue change
- Negative number = source of cash (working capital release)
- Positive number = use of cash (working capital build)

**Maintenance vs Growth CapEx:**
- Maintenance CapEx: Sustains current operations (~2-3% revenue)
- Growth CapEx: Supports expansion (additional 2-5% revenue)
- Total CapEx should align with company's growth strategy

## Data sources — MCP first, web fallback

Many passages below say "use the S&P Kensho MCP / Daloopa MCP / FactSet MCP". Those are commercial financial-data MCPs from the original Cowork plugin context. In Hermes:

- **If you have any structured financial-data MCP configured** (Hermes supports MCP — see `native-mcp` skill), prefer it for point-in-time comps, precedent transactions, and filings.
- **Otherwise**, fall back to:
  - `web_search` / `web_extract` against SEC EDGAR (`https://www.sec.gov/cgi-bin/browse-edgar`) for US filings
  - Company IR pages for press releases, earnings decks
  - `browser_navigate` for interactive data portals
  - User-provided data (explicitly ask when the context doesn't have it)
- **Never fabricate**. If a multiple, precedent, or filing number can't be sourced, flag the cell as `[UNSOURCED]` and surface it to the user.
