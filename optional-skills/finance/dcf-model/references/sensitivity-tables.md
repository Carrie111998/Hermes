# Sensitivity Tables — Step 10, Correct Implementation, Wrong Shortcuts, Sheet Placement

### Step 10: Sensitivity Analysis

Build **three sensitivity tables** at the bottom of the DCF sheet showing how valuation changes with different assumptions:

1. **WACC vs Terminal Growth** - Shows enterprise value sensitivity to discount rate and perpetuity growth
2. **Revenue Growth vs EBIT Margin** - Shows impact of top-line growth and operating leverage
3. **Beta vs Risk-Free Rate** - Shows sensitivity to cost of equity components

**Implementation**: These are simple 2D grids (NOT Excel's "Data Table" feature) with formulas in each cell. Each cell must contain a full DCF recalculation for that specific assumption combination. See Critical Constraints section for detailed requirements on populating all 75 cells programmatically using openpyxl.

### Correct Sensitivity Table Implementation

**IMPORTANT**: These are NOT Excel's "Data Table" feature. These are simple grids where you write regular formulas using openpyxl. Yes, this means ~75 formulas total (3 tables × 25 cells each), but this is straightforward and required.

**Programmatic Population with Formulas:**

Each sensitivity table must be fully populated with formulas that recalculate the implied share price for each combination of assumptions. **Do not use Excel's Data Table feature** (it requires manual intervention and cannot be automated via openpyxl).

**Implementation approach - CONCRETE EXAMPLE:**

**Table Structure — 5×5 grid (ODD dimensions, base case centered):**

If the model's base WACC = 9.0% and base terminal growth = 3.0%, build the axes symmetrically around those values:

```csv
WACC vs Terminal Growth,  2.0%,  2.5%,  3.0%,  3.5%,  4.0%
              8.0%,       [fml], [fml], [fml], [fml], [fml]
              8.5%,       [fml], [fml], [fml], [fml], [fml]
              9.0%,       [fml], [fml], [★  ], [fml], [fml]   ← middle row = base WACC
              9.5%,       [fml], [fml], [fml], [fml], [fml]
             10.0%,       [fml], [fml], [fml], [fml], [fml]
                                   ↑
                          middle col = base terminal g
```

**★ = the center cell.** Its formula output MUST equal the model's actual implied share price (from the valuation summary). Apply the medium-blue fill (`#BDD7EE`) and bold font to this cell so the base case is visually anchored.

**Rule for axis values:** `axis_values = [base - 2*step, base - step, base, base + step, base + 2*step]` — symmetric around the base, odd count guarantees a center.

**Formula Pattern - Cell B88 (WACC=8.0%, Terminal Growth=2.0%):**

The formula in B88 should recalculate the implied price using:
- WACC from row header: `$A88` (8.0%)
- Terminal Growth from column header: `B$87` (2.0%)

**Recommended approach:** Reference the main DCF calculation but substitute these values.

**Example formula structure:**
`=([SUM of PV FCFs using $A88 as discount rate] + [Terminal Value using B$87 as growth rate and $A88 as WACC] - [Net Debt]) / [Shares]`

**CRITICAL - Write a formula for EVERY cell in the 5x5 grid (25 cells per table, 75 cells total).** Use openpyxl to write these formulas programmatically in a loop. Do NOT skip this step or leave placeholder text.

**Python implementation pattern:**
```python
# Pseudocode for populating sensitivity table
for row_idx, wacc_value in enumerate(wacc_range):
    for col_idx, term_growth_value in enumerate(term_growth_range):
        # Build formula that uses wacc_value and term_growth_value
        formula = f"=<DCF recalc using {wacc_value} and {term_growth_value}>"
        ws.cell(row=start_row+row_idx, column=start_col+col_idx).value = formula
```

**The sensitivity tables must work immediately when the model is opened, with no manual steps required from the user.**

### WRONG: Simplified Sensitivity Table Approximations or Placeholder Text

**Don't use linear approximations:**

```
// WRONG - Linear approximation
B97: =B88*(1+(0.096-0.116))    // Assumes linear relationship

// WRONG - Division shortcut
B105: =B88/(1+(E48-0.07))      // Doesn't recalculate full DCF
```

**Don't leave placeholder text:**
```
// WRONG - Placeholder note
"Note: Use Excel Data Table feature (Data → What-If Analysis → Data Table) to populate sensitivity tables."

// WRONG - Empty cells
[leaving cells blank because "this is complex"]
```

**Don't confuse terminology:**
- ❌ "Sensitivity tables need Excel's Data Table feature" (NO - that's a specific Excel tool we can't use)
- ✅ "Sensitivity tables are simple grids with formulas in each cell" (YES - this is what we build)

**Why these shortcuts are wrong:**
- Linear approximation formulas don't actually recalculate the DCF - they just apply simple math adjustments
- The relationships are not linear, so the results will be inaccurate
- Placeholder text requires manual user intervention
- Model is not immediately usable when delivered
- Not professional or client-ready
- Empty cells = incomplete deliverable

**Common rationalization to REJECT:**
"Writing 75+ formulas feels complex, so I'll leave a note for the user to complete it manually."

**Reality:** Writing 75 formulas is straightforward when you use a loop in Python with openpyxl. Each formula follows the same pattern - just substitute the row/column values. This is a required part of the deliverable.

**Instead:** Populate every sensitivity cell with formulas that recalculate the full DCF for that specific combination of assumptions

### Sensitivity Analysis (Bottom of DCF Sheet)

**TERMINOLOGY REMINDER**: "Sensitivity tables" = simple 2D grids with row headers, column headers, and formulas in each data cell. NOT Excel's "Data Table" feature (Data → What-If Analysis → Data Table). You will use openpyxl to write regular Excel formulas into each cell.

**Location**: Rows 87+ on DCF sheet (NOT a separate sheet)

**Three sensitivity tables, vertically stacked:**

1. **WACC vs Terminal Growth** (rows 87-100) - 5x5 grid = 25 cells with formulas
2. **Revenue Growth vs EBIT Margin** (rows 102-115) - 5x5 grid = 25 cells with formulas
3. **Beta vs Risk-Free Rate** (rows 117-130) - 5x5 grid = 25 cells with formulas

**Total formulas to write: 75** (this is required, not optional)

**CRITICAL**: All sensitivity table cells must be populated programmatically with formulas using openpyxl. DO NOT use linear approximation shortcuts. DO NOT leave placeholder text or notes about manual steps. DO NOT rationalize leaving cells empty because "it's complex" - use a Python loop to generate the formulas.

**Table Setup:**
1. Create table structure with row/column headers (the assumption values to test)
2. Populate EVERY data cell with a formula that:
   - Uses the row header value (e.g., WACC = 9.0%)
   - Uses the column header value (e.g., Terminal Growth = 3.0%)
   - Recalculates the full DCF with those specific assumptions
   - Returns the implied share price for that scenario
3. All cells must contain working formulas when delivered
4. Format cells with conditional formatting: Green scale for higher values, red scale for lower values
5. Bold the base case cell
6. Leave 1-2 blank rows between tables

**No manual intervention required** - the sensitivity tables must be fully functional when the user opens the file.
