# Common Mistakes — Wrong Patterns and Error Catalog

<common_mistakes>

This section contains all the WRONG patterns to avoid when building DCF models.

### WRONG: Missing Cell Comments

**Don't do this:**
- Create all hardcoded inputs without comments
- Think "I'll add them later"
- Write "TODO: add source"
- Leave blue inputs without documentation

**Why it's wrong:**
- Can't verify where data came from
- Fails xlsx skill requirements
- Not audit-ready
- Wastes time fixing later

**Instead:** Add cell comment AS EACH hardcoded value is created

### WRONG: Formula Row References Off

**Symptom:**
The FCF section references wrong assumption rows:
`D&A:  =E29*$E$34    // Should be $E$21, but referencing wrong row`
`CapEx: =E29*$E$41   // Should be $E$22, but row shifted`

**Why this happens:**
1. Formulas written first
2. Then headers inserted
3. All row references shifted
4. Now formulas point to wrong cells → #REF! errors

**Instead:** Lock row layout FIRST, then write formulas

### WRONG: No Borders

**Don't deliver a model without borders:**
- No section delineation
- All cells blend together
- Hard to read and unprofessional

**Why it's wrong:**
- Not client-ready
- Difficult to navigate
- Looks amateur

**Instead:** Add borders around all major sections

### WRONG: Wrong Font Colors or No Font Color Distinction

**Don't do this:**
- All text is black
- Only use fill colors (no font color changes)
- Mix up which cells are blue vs black

**Why it's wrong:**
- Can't distinguish inputs from formulas
- Auditing becomes impossible
- Violates xlsx skill requirements

**Instead:** Blue text for ALL hardcoded inputs, black text for ALL formulas, green for sheet links

### WRONG: Operating Expenses Based on Gross Profit

**Don't do this:**
`S&M: =E33*0.15    // E33 = Gross Profit (WRONG)`

**Why it's wrong:**
- Operating expenses scale with revenue, not gross profit
- Produces unrealistic margin progression
- Not how businesses actually operate

**Instead:**
`S&M: =E29*0.15    // E29 = Revenue (CORRECT)`

### TOP 5 ERRORS SUMMARY

1. **Formula row references off** → Define ALL row positions BEFORE writing formulas
2. **Missing cell comments** → Add comments AS cells are created, not at end
3. **Simplified sensitivity tables** → Populate all cells with full DCF recalc formulas, not approximations
4. **Scenario block references wrong** → Ensure IF formulas pull from correct Bear/Base/Bull blocks
5. **No borders** → Add professional section borders for client-ready appearance

In addition, be aware of these errors:

### WACC Calculation Errors
- Mixing book and market values in capital structure
- Using equity beta instead of asset/unlevered beta incorrectly
- Wrong tax rate application to cost of debt
- Incorrect risk-free rate (must use current 10Y Treasury)
- Failure to adjust for net debt vs net cash position

### Growth Assumption Flaws
- Terminal growth > WACC (creates infinite value)
- Projection growth rates inconsistent with historical performance
- Ignoring industry growth constraints
- Revenue growth not aligned with unit economics
- Margin expansion without operational justification

### Terminal Value Mistakes
- Using wrong growth method (perpetuity vs exit multiple)
- Terminal value >80% of enterprise value (suggests over-reliance)
- Inconsistent terminal margins with steady state assumptions
- Wrong discount period for terminal value

### Cash Flow Projection Errors
- Operating expenses based on gross profit instead of revenue
- D&A/CapEx percentages misaligned with business model
- Working capital changes not properly calculated
- Tax rate inconsistency between years
- NOPAT calculation errors

**These errors are the most common. Re-read this section before starting any DCF build.**
