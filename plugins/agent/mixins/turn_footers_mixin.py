"""Per-turn footer rendering for ``AIAgent``

Extracted from ``run_agent.py`` as part of the god-file decomposition
campaign (Phase 3 mechanical mixin lifts).  Behavior-neutral: every method
is lifted verbatim from ``AIAgent``; ``self.*``/``cls.*`` calls resolve
unchanged via the MRO (class attributes referenced through ``cls.`` stay on
``AIAgent``).  The module-level ``logger`` keeps the original logger name
(``"run_agent"``) so log records are unchanged.
