"""F4 regression tests: no_agent script lane cannot tamper with config.yaml.

Approval policy (approvals.cron_mode / approvals.mode / yolo) lives in
config.yaml and approval reads are mtime-keyed, so a no_agent script that
rewrites config.yaml would flip the approval gate and the next tick would
pick the flip up. Scripts run as subprocesses OUTSIDE the file_tools /
terminal hard-blocks that protect config.yaml.

These tests pin the snapshot/restore guard in cron/scheduler.py:
- a script that modifies config.yaml during its run is detected, the
  change is reverted, and the run fails with a clear message,
- a benign script leaves config.yaml untouched and succeeds,
- a script that DELETES config.yaml is also caught and restored.
