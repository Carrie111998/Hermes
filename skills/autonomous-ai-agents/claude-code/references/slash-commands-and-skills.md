# Slash Commands, Custom Commands & Skills

Built-in slash commands by category, how to define custom `.claude/commands/*.md` commands, and how skills are invoked in natural language.

## Interactive Session: Slash Commands

### Session & Context
| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `/help` | Show all commands (including custom and MCP commands) |
| `/compact [focus]` | Compress context to save tokens; CLAUDE.md survives compaction. E.g., `/compact focus on auth logic` |
| `/clear` | Wipe conversation history for a fresh start |
| `/context` | Visualize context usage as a colored grid with optimization tips |
| `/cost` | View token usage with per-model and cache-hit breakdowns |
| `/resume` | Switch to or resume a different session |
| `/rewind` | Revert to a previous checkpoint in conversation or code |
| `/btw <question>` | Ask a side question without adding to context cost |
| `/status` | Show version, connectivity, and session info |
| `/todos` | List tracked action items from the conversation |
| `/exit` or `Ctrl+D` | End session |

### Development & Review
| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `/review` | Request code review of current changes |
| `/security-review` | Perform security analysis of current changes |
| `/plan [description]` | Enter Plan mode with auto-start for task planning |
| `/loop [interval]` | Schedule recurring tasks within the session |
| `/batch` | Auto-create worktrees for large parallel changes (5-30 worktrees) |

### Configuration & Tools
| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `/model [model]` | Switch models mid-session (use arrow keys to adjust effort) |
| `/effort [level]` | Set reasoning effort: `low`, `medium`, `high`, `max`, or `auto` |
| `/init` | Create a CLAUDE.md file for project memory |
| `/memory` | Open CLAUDE.md for editing |
| `/config` | Open interactive settings configuration |
| `/permissions` | View/update tool permissions |
| `/agents` | Manage specialized subagents |
| `/mcp` | Interactive UI to manage MCP servers |
| `/add-dir` | Add additional working directories (useful for monorepos) |
| `/usage` | Show plan limits and rate limit status |
| `/voice` | Enable push-to-talk voice mode (20 languages; hold Space to record, release to send) |
| `/release-notes` | Interactive picker for version release notes |

### Custom Slash Commands
Create `.claude/commands/<name>.md` (project-shared) or `~/.claude/commands/<name>.md` (personal):

```markdown
# .claude/commands/deploy.md
Run the deploy pipeline:
1. Run all tests
2. Build the Docker image
3. Push to registry
4. Update the $ARGUMENTS environment (default: staging)
```

Usage: `/deploy production` — `$ARGUMENTS` is replaced with the user's input.

### Skills (Natural Language Invocation)
Unlike slash commands (manually invoked), skills in `.claude/skills/` are markdown guides that Claude invokes automatically via natural language when the task matches:

```markdown
# .claude/skills/database-migration.md
When asked to create or modify database migrations:
1. Use Alembic for migration generation
2. Always create a rollback function
3. Test migrations against a local database copy
```
