# Notion Setup & Auth

Same integration token works for both the `ntn` CLI and raw HTTP.

## 1. Get an integration token (required for both paths)

1. Create an integration at https://notion.so/my-integrations
2. Copy the API key (starts with `ntn_` or `secret_`)
3. Store in `${HERMES_HOME:-~/.hermes}/.env`:
   ```
   NOTION_API_KEY=ntn_your_key_here
   ```
4. **Share target pages/databases with the integration** in Notion: page menu `...` → `Connect to` → your integration name. Without this, the API returns 404 for that page even though it exists.

## 2. Install `ntn` (preferred path on macOS / Linux)

```bash
# Recommended
curl -fsSL https://ntn.dev | bash

# Or via npm (needs Node 22+, npm 10+)
npm install --global ntn

ntn --version    # verify
```

**Skip `ntn login` — use the integration token instead.** This works headlessly, no browser needed:
```bash
export NOTION_API_TOKEN=$NOTION_API_KEY      # ntn reads NOTION_API_TOKEN
export NOTION_KEYRING=0                       # don't try to use the OS keychain
```

Add those exports to your shell profile (or to `${HERMES_HOME:-~/.hermes}/.env`) so every session inherits them.

## 3. Choose path at runtime

```bash
if command -v ntn >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  # use ntn
else
  # fall back to curl
fi
```

Windows users: skip step 2 entirely until native `ntn` ships — the HTTP path works fine. If you want CLI ergonomics now, install `ntn` inside WSL2.

## Useful `ntn` env vars

| Var | Effect |
|---|---|
| `NOTION_API_TOKEN` | Auth token (overrides keychain) — set this to your integration token |
| `NOTION_KEYRING=0` | File-based creds at `~/.config/notion/auth.json` instead of OS keychain |
| `NOTION_WORKSPACE_ID` | Skip the workspace picker prompt |

## API version

`Notion-Version: 2025-09-03` is required on all HTTP requests. `ntn` handles this for you. In this version, what users call "databases" are called **data sources** in the API.

## Choosing the right path

| Task | mac / Linux | Windows |
|---|---|---|
| Read/write pages, search, query databases | `ntn api ...` | curl |
| Read a page for an agent to summarize | `ntn api v1/pages/{id}/markdown` | curl `/markdown` endpoint |
| Upload a file | `ntn files create < file` | 3-step HTTP flow |
| One-off API exploration | `ntn api ...` | curl |
| Build a sync / webhook / agent tool hosted by Notion | `ntn workers ...` | WSL2 + `ntn workers ...` |

## Notes

- The two paths: **`ntn` CLI** is Notion's official CLI — shorter syntax, one-line file uploads, required for Workers; macOS + Linux only as of May 2026 (Windows support "coming soon"). **Default when installed.** **HTTP + curl** works everywhere including Windows — default fallback.
- Notion also ships an MCP server now (`Notion MCP`, ~91% more token-efficient on DB ops than the previous version) — wire it via Hermes' MCP support if you want streaming Notion access from inside a session, but the CLI/HTTP paths are enough for most one-shot tasks.
