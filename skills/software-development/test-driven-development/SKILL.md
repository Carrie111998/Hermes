# Test-Driven Development (TDD)

## Overview

Write the test first. Watch it fail. Write minimal code to pass.

**Core principle:** If you didn't watch the test fail, you don't know if it tests the right thing.

**Violating the letter of the rules is violating the spirit of the rules.**

## When to Use

**Always:**
- New features
- Bug fixes
- Refactoring
- Behavior changes

**Exceptions (ask the user first):**
- Throwaway prototypes
- Generated code
- Configuration files

Thinking "skip TDD just this once"? Stop. That's rationalization.

## Reference Map

| To do this | Read |
|---|---|
| See a good vs bad test, minimal vs bloated GREEN code, the exact verify commands, vertical-vs-horizontal slicing diagram | `references/test-examples.md` |
| Answer "why not write tests after?" and every other excuse, long-form or as a table | `references/rationalizations.md` |
| Run the cycle with Hermes `terminal`; enforce TDD in `delegate_task`; combine with systematic-debugging | `references/hermes-integration.md` |

## The Iron Law

```
NO PRODUCTION CODE WITHOUT A FAILING TEST FIRST
```

Write code before the test? Delete it. Start over.

**No exceptions:**
- Don't keep it as "reference"
- Don't "adapt" it while writing tests
- Don't look at it
- Delete means delete

Implement fresh from tests. Period.

## End-to-End Skeleton

```
1. Write ONE minimal failing test for ONE behavior.
2. Run it. Watch it fail for the RIGHT reason.        # mandatory
3. Write the simplest code that passes. Cheating allowed.
4. Run it. Watch it pass. Run the full suite.          # mandatory
5. Refactor with tests staying green. Add no behavior.
6. Next behavior → back to 1. One vertical slice at a time.
```

## Red-Green-Refactor Cycle

### RED — Write Failing Test

Write one minimal test showing what should happen.

**Requirements:**
- One behavior per test
- Clear descriptive name ("and" in name? Split it)
- Real code, not mocks (unless truly unavoidable)
- Name describes behavior, not implementation

Worked good/bad examples: `references/test-examples.md`.

### Verify RED — Watch It Fail

**MANDATORY. Never skip.** Run the specific test.

Confirm:
- Test fails (not errors from typos)
- Failure message is expected
- Fails because the feature is missing

**Test passes immediately?** You're testing existing behavior. Fix the test.

**Test errors?** Fix the error, re-run until it fails correctly.

### GREEN — Minimal Code

Write the simplest code to pass the test. Nothing more.

Don't add features, refactor other code, or "improve" beyond the test.

**Cheating is OK in GREEN:**
- Hardcode return values
- Copy-paste
- Duplicate code
- Skip edge cases

We'll fix it in REFACTOR.

### Verify GREEN — Watch It Pass

**MANDATORY.** Run the specific test, then run ALL tests to check for regressions.

Confirm:
- Test passes
- Other tests still pass
- Output pristine (no errors, warnings)

**Test fails?** Fix the code, not the test.

**Other tests fail?** Fix regressions now.

### REFACTOR — Clean Up

After green only:
- Remove duplication
- Improve names
- Extract helpers
- Simplify expressions

Keep tests green throughout. Don't add behavior.

**If tests fail during refactor:** Undo immediately. Take smaller steps.

### Repeat

Next failing test for next behavior. One cycle at a time.

## Avoid Horizontal Slices

Do **not** write all tests first and then all implementation. That is horizontal slicing: RED becomes "write a pile of imagined tests" and GREEN becomes "make the pile pass." It produces brittle tests because the tests are designed before the implementation has taught you what behavior and interface actually matter.

Use vertical tracer bullets instead: one end-to-end behavior slice per cycle. It proves the path works, teaches you about the interface, and keeps each next test grounded in what you just learned. Diagram: `references/test-examples.md`.

## Red Flags — STOP and Start Over

If you catch yourself doing any of these, delete the code and restart with TDD:

- Code before test
- Test after implementation
- Test passes immediately on first run
- Can't explain why test failed
- Tests added "later"
- Rationalizing "just this once"
- "I already manually tested it"
- "Tests after achieve the same purpose"
- "Keep as reference" or "adapt existing code"
- "Already spent X hours, deleting is wasteful"
- "TDD is dogmatic, I'm being pragmatic"
- "This is different because..."

**All of these mean: Delete code. Start over with TDD.**

Rebuttals for each excuse: `references/rationalizations.md`.

## Testing Anti-Patterns

- **Testing mock behavior instead of real behavior** — mocks should verify interactions, not replace the system under test
- **Testing implementation details** — test behavior/results, not internal method calls
- **Happy path only** — always test edge cases, errors, and boundaries
- **Brittle tests** — tests should verify behavior, not structure; refactoring shouldn't break them
- **Weakening a test to make it pass** — never. Fix the production code instead.

## Verification Checklist

Before marking work complete:

- [ ] Every new function/method has a test
- [ ] Watched each test fail before implementing
- [ ] Each test failed for expected reason (feature missing, not typo)
- [ ] Wrote minimal code to pass each test
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] Output pristine (no errors, warnings)
- [ ] Tests use real code (mocks only if unavoidable)
- [ ] Edge cases and errors covered

Can't check all boxes? You skipped TDD. Start over.

## When Stuck

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Don't know how to test | Write the wished-for API. Write the assertion first. Ask the user. |
| Test too complicated | Design too complicated. Simplify the interface. |
| Must mock everything | Code too coupled. Use dependency injection. |
| Test setup huge | Extract helpers. Still complex? Simplify the design. |

## Final Rule

```
Production code → test exists and failed first
Otherwise → not TDD
```

No exceptions without the user's explicit permission.
