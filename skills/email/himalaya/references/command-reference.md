# Himalaya Command Reference

## List Folders

```bash
himalaya folder list
```

## List Emails

List emails in INBOX (default):

```bash
himalaya envelope list
```

List emails in a specific folder:

```bash
himalaya envelope list --folder "Sent"
```

List with pagination:

```bash
himalaya envelope list --page 1 --page-size 20
```

## Search Emails

```bash
himalaya envelope list from john@example.com subject meeting
```

## Read an Email

Read email by ID (shows plain text):

```bash
himalaya message read 42
```

Export raw MIME:

```bash
himalaya message export 42 --full
```

## Reply to an Email

To reply non-interactively from Hermes, read the original message, compose a reply, and pipe it:

```bash
# Get the reply template, edit it, and send
himalaya template reply 42 | sed 's/^$/\nYour reply text here\n/' | himalaya template send
```

Or build the reply manually:

```bash
cat << 'EOF' | himalaya template send
From: you@example.com
To: sender@example.com
Subject: Re: Original Subject
In-Reply-To: <original-message-id>

Your reply here.
EOF
```

Reply-all (interactive — needs $EDITOR, use the template approach above instead):

```bash
himalaya message reply 42 --all
```

## Forward an Email

```bash
# Get forward template and pipe with modifications
himalaya template forward 42 | sed 's/^To:.*/To: newrecipient@example.com/' | himalaya template send
```

## Write a New Email

**Non-interactive (use this from Hermes)** — pipe the message via stdin:

```bash
cat << 'EOF' | himalaya template send
From: you@example.com
To: recipient@example.com
Subject: Test Message

Hello from Himalaya!
EOF
```

Or with headers flag:

```bash
himalaya message write -H "To:recipient@example.com" -H "Subject:Test" "Message body here"
```

Note: `himalaya message write` without piped input opens `$EDITOR`. This works with `pty=true` + background mode, but piping is simpler and more reliable.

For rich emails with attachments and inline images, use MML — see
`references/message-composition.md`.

## Move/Copy Emails

Move to folder (target folder comes first, then the message ID):

```bash
himalaya message move "Archive" 42
```

Copy to folder (target folder comes first, then the message ID):

```bash
himalaya message copy "Important" 42
```

## Delete an Email

```bash
himalaya message delete 42
```

## Manage Flags

Add flag:

```bash
himalaya flag add 42 --flag seen
```

Remove flag:

```bash
himalaya flag remove 42 --flag seen
```

## Multiple Accounts

List accounts:

```bash
himalaya account list
```

Use a specific account:

```bash
himalaya --account work envelope list
```

Multi-account config layout lives in `references/configuration.md`.

## Attachments

Save attachments from a message:

```bash
himalaya attachment download 42
```

Save to specific directory:

```bash
himalaya attachment download 42 --downloads-dir ~/Downloads
```

## Output Formats

Most commands support `--output` for structured output:

```bash
himalaya envelope list --output json
himalaya envelope list --output plain
```

## Debugging

Enable debug logging:

```bash
RUST_LOG=debug himalaya envelope list
```

Full trace with backtrace:

```bash
RUST_LOG=trace RUST_BACKTRACE=1 himalaya envelope list
```

## Tips

- Use `himalaya --help` or `himalaya <command> --help` for detailed usage.
- Message IDs are relative to the current folder; re-list after folder changes.
- Use `--output json` for structured output that's easier to parse programmatically.
- **Reading, listing, searching, moving, deleting** all work directly through the terminal tool.
- **Composing/replying/forwarding** — piped input (`cat << EOF | himalaya template send`) is recommended for reliability. Interactive `$EDITOR` mode works with `pty=true` + background + process tool, but requires knowing the editor and its commands.
