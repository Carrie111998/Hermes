This skill is ported from [blader/humanizer](https://github.com/blader/humanizer) (MIT licensed), which is itself based on [Wikipedia: Signs of AI writing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Signs_of_AI_writing), maintained by WikiProject AI Cleanup. The patterns documented there come from observations of thousands of instances of AI-generated text on Wikipedia.

Original author: Siqi Chen ([@blader](https://github.com/blader)). Original repo: https://github.com/blader/humanizer (version 2.5.1). Ported to Hermes Agent with Hermes-native tool references (`read_file`, `patch`, `write_file`) and guidance for when to load the skill; the 29 patterns, personality/soul section, and full worked example are preserved verbatim from the source. Original MIT license preserved in the `LICENSE` file alongside this `SKILL.md`.

Key insight from Wikipedia: "LLMs use statistical algorithms to guess what should come next. The result tends toward the most statistically likely result that applies to the widest variety of cases."
