# Updating & Uninstalling

## Updating

Update with a single command:

```bash
hermes update
```

By default, this pulls the latest code from `main`, updates dependencies, and prompts you to configure any new options that were added since your last update. You can instead pin updates to official tagged releases with the release track described below.

:::tip
`hermes update` automatically detects new configuration options and prompts you to add them. If you skipped that prompt, you can manually run `hermes config check` to see missing options, then `hermes config migrate` to interactively add them.
:::

### What happens during an update

When you run `hermes update`, the following steps occur:

1. **Pre-update snapshot** — a lightweight state snapshot is saved by default (covers pairing data, cron jobs, `config.yaml`, `.env`, `auth.json`, and other state files that get modified at runtime; individual files over 1 GiB are skipped so a large sessions DB never slows the update down). Controlled by `updates.pre_update_backup` (`quick` by default, `full` for a zip of all of `HERMES_HOME`, `off` to disable). Recoverable via the snapshot restore flow described under [Snapshots and rollback](../user-guide/checkpoints-and-rollback.md).
2. **Target resolution and checkout** — updates the selected branch (the `main` branch by default), or resolves and checks out the exact commit for an official release when using the release track; submodules are updated afterward
3. **Post-pull syntax validation + auto-rollback** — after the pull, Hermes compiles the nine critical files every `hermes` invocation imports at startup. If any fails to parse (e.g. an orphan merge-conflict marker, an accidentally truncated file), Hermes runs `git reset --hard <pre-pull-sha>` to roll the install back so your shell stays bootable. Re-run `hermes update` once the upstream fix lands.
4. **Dependency install** — runs `uv pip install -e ".[all]"` to pick up new or changed dependencies
5. **Config migration** — detects new config options added since your version and prompts you to set them
6. **Gateway auto-restart** — running gateways are refreshed after the update completes so the new code takes effect immediately. Service-managed gateways (systemd on Linux, launchd on macOS) are restarted through the service manager. Manual gateways are relaunched automatically when Hermes can map the running PID back to a profile.

### Pinning official releases: `--release`

Use the release track to install an official version published on the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent/releases), rather than following the moving tip of a branch:

```bash
hermes update --release                 # latest published release
hermes update --release v2026.7.20      # one exact release
hermes update --check --release         # check the latest release only
hermes update --check --release v2026.7.20
```

Official release tags use the date-based form `vYYYY.M.D`, with an optional fourth numeric component such as `vYYYY.M.D.N`. An explicitly requested tag must also exist as a published GitHub release. Hermes resolves the release through the official `NousResearch/hermes-agent` repository, verifies the tag's peeled commit, fetches that exact commit, and checks it out. `--release` and `--branch` are mutually exclusive.

A release checkout intentionally uses a **detached HEAD**. This means the source tree is pinned to the release commit instead of being attached to a local branch. It is normal for `git status` to report `HEAD detached`; do not create commits there unless you intend to manage a custom checkout. A later release-track update moves the detached HEAD to the exact commit of the selected release. Running a branch-track update instead switches the checkout back to that branch.

`hermes update --check --release` resolves the latest official release and compares its exact commit with the currently installed `HEAD`. It reports an update whenever those commits differ, including when `HEAD` is a descendant of the release tag on `main`. The check fetches release metadata and the selected tag, but it does not check out the release, reinstall dependencies, or restart gateways.

For an exact check-to-install handoff, `--release-commit <full-40-character-SHA>` can accompany `--release [TAG]`. Hermes refuses the update if the official tag no longer resolves to that checked commit. `--release-commit` is invalid without `--release`.

### Choosing a persistent update track: `updates.channel`

The command-line flags above select a target for one invocation. To make release updates the default, set `updates.channel` in `~/.hermes/config.yaml`:

```yaml
updates:
  channel: release
```

The supported values are:

- `main` (default) — bare `hermes update` and `hermes update --check` follow `origin/main`.
- `release` — bare `hermes update` pins the latest official release, and bare `hermes update --check` checks the latest official release.

An explicit `--release [TAG]` selects a release for that invocation without changing the saved channel. An explicit `--branch <name>` is a one-time branch-track override, including when `updates.channel` is `release`.

### Updating against a non-default branch: `--branch`

By default `hermes update` tracks `origin/main`. Pass `--branch <name>` to update against a different branch — useful for QA channels, feature branches, or release-candidate testing:

```bash
hermes update --branch release-candidate
hermes update --check --branch experimental   # preview behindness only
```

If your local checkout is on a different branch, Hermes auto-stashes any uncommitted work, switches HEAD to the target branch, and then pulls. Branches that don't exist locally are auto-tracked from `origin/<name>` (`git checkout -B <name> origin/<name>`). Branches that don't exist anywhere fail cleanly — your stashed changes are restored before exit so you're never stranded in a weird state. The `main`-only fork-upstream sync logic is automatically skipped on non-`main` branches.

### Local changes on non-interactive updates

When you run `hermes update` in a terminal, Hermes stashes any uncommitted source-tree changes, pulls, then **asks** whether to restore them — exactly as it always has. Nothing changes for interactive updates.

When the update runs **without a terminal** — from the desktop/chat app's "Update" button or a gateway-triggered update — there's no prompt to answer. The `updates.non_interactive_local_changes` setting decides what happens to your stashed changes:

```yaml
# ~/.hermes/config.yaml
updates:
  non_interactive_local_changes: stash   # default: keep + auto-restore
  # non_interactive_local_changes: discard  # throw local source edits away
```

- `stash` (default) — auto-stash, pull, then auto-restore your changes on top of the updated code. Nothing is lost; if a restore hits conflicts they're preserved in a git stash for manual recovery.
- `discard` — auto-stash and drop the stash after the pull, so the update always lands on a clean tree. Use this only on machines where you never intend to keep local edits to the Hermes source. It stash-drops (not `git reset --hard` + `git clean -fd`), so ignored paths like `node_modules`, `venv`, and build outputs are never touched.

In the desktop app this is **Settings → Advanced → In-App Update Local Changes**.

### Preview-only: `hermes update --check`

Want to know if an update is available before installing it? Run `hermes update --check`. On the default `main` channel it fetches and compares commits against `origin/main`; on the `release` channel it performs the exact official-release comparison described above. Add `--branch <name>` or `--release [TAG]` to check a one-time target. The command does not check out code, reinstall dependencies, or restart gateways. It is useful in scripts and cron jobs that gate on "is there an update".

### Full pre-update backup: `--backup`

For high-value profiles (production gateways, shared team installs) you can opt into a full pre-pull backup of `HERMES_HOME` (config, auth, sessions, skills, pairing):

```bash
hermes update --backup
```

Or make it the default for every run:

```yaml
# ~/.hermes/config.yaml
updates:
  pre_update_backup: full
```

`updates.pre_update_backup` is a single knob with three modes: `quick` (default — the lightweight state snapshot described above), `full` (the quick snapshot plus a complete `HERMES_HOME` zip; can add minutes on large homes), and `off` (no pre-update backup at all — `--no-backup` does the same for a single run). Legacy boolean values still work: `true` means `full`, `false` means `off`.

### Windows: another `hermes.exe` is running

On Windows, `hermes update` will refuse to run if it detects another `hermes.exe` process holding the venv's entry-point executable open — most commonly the Hermes Desktop app's spawned backend, an open `hermes` REPL in another terminal, or a running gateway:

```
$ hermes update
✗ Another hermes.exe is running:
    PID 12345  hermes.exe

  Updating now would fail to overwrite ...\venv\Scripts\hermes.exe because
  Windows blocks REPLACE on a running executable.

  Close Hermes Desktop, exit any open `hermes` REPLs, and
  stop the gateway (`hermes gateway stop`) before retrying.
  Override with `hermes update --force` if you've already
  confirmed those processes will not write to the venv.
```

Close the listed processes and re-run. If you're sure the concurrent process won't interfere (rare — usually only useful when an antivirus shim is mis-attributed), pass `--force` to skip the check. In that case the updater will still retry the `.exe` rename with exponential backoff and, on stubborn locks, schedule the replacement for next reboot via `MoveFileEx(MOVEFILE_DELAY_UNTIL_REBOOT)` so the update can complete.

A second, separate guard refuses to touch the venv while any process is running from its Python interpreter (the Desktop app's backend, a gateway, a Python REPL). Those processes keep native extension files (`.pyd`) locked, and a dependency sync that dies partway on an access-denied error strands the install between versions. This guard is **not** bypassed by `--force`; if you're certain the detected holders are false positives, use the explicit `hermes update --force-venv`.

:::warning Release track and the Windows ZIP fallback
When Git file I/O is unavailable or fails on Windows, Hermes can fall back to a ZIP archive of the moving `main` branch. That archive cannot preserve an exact release pin, so release-track updates deliberately stop instead of silently installing `main`. Resolve the Git file-I/O problem, then rerun `hermes update --release`. The same ZIP fallback limitation applies when `updates.channel` is `release`.
:::

Expected output looks like:

```
$ hermes update
Updating Hermes Agent...
📥 Pulling latest code...
Already up to date.  (or: Updating abc1234..def5678)
📦 Updating dependencies...
✅ Dependencies updated
🔍 Checking for new config options...
✅ Config is up to date  (or: Found 2 new options — running migration...)
🔄 Restarting gateways...
✅ Gateway restarted
✅ Hermes Agent updated successfully!
```

### Recommended Post-Update Validation

`hermes update` handles the main update path, but a quick validation confirms everything landed cleanly:

1. `git status --short` — if the tree is unexpectedly dirty, inspect before continuing
2. `hermes doctor` — checks config, dependencies, and service health
3. `hermes --version` — confirm the version bumped as expected
4. If you use the gateway: `hermes gateway status`
5. If `doctor` reports npm audit issues: run `npm audit fix` in the flagged directory

:::warning Dirty working tree after update
If `git status --short` shows unexpected changes after `hermes update`, stop and inspect them before continuing. This usually means local modifications were reapplied on top of the updated code, or a dependency step refreshed lockfiles.
:::

### If your terminal disconnects mid-update

`hermes update` protects itself against accidental terminal loss:

- The update ignores `SIGHUP`, so closing your SSH session or terminal window no longer kills it mid-install. `pip` and `git` child processes inherit this protection, so the Python environment cannot be left half-installed by a dropped connection.
- All output is mirrored to `~/.hermes/logs/update.log` while the update runs. If your terminal disappears, reconnect and inspect the log to see whether the update finished and whether the gateway restart succeeded:

```bash
tail -f ~/.hermes/logs/update.log
```

- `Ctrl-C` (SIGINT) and system shutdown (SIGTERM) are still honored — those are deliberate cancellations, not accidents.

You no longer need to wrap `hermes update` in `screen` or `tmux` to survive a terminal drop.

### Checking your current version

```bash
hermes version
```

Compare against the latest release at the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent/releases).

### Updating from Messaging Platforms

You can also update directly from Telegram, Discord, Slack, WhatsApp, or Teams by sending:

```
/update
```

This updates from the target selected by `updates.channel`, updates dependencies, and restarts running gateways. The bot will briefly go offline during the restart (typically 5–15 seconds) and then resume.

### Manual Update

If you installed manually (not via the quick installer):

```bash
cd /path/to/hermes-agent
# Activate the venv you created during install (outside the source tree)
export VIRTUAL_ENV="$HOME/.hermes/venvs/hermes-dev"
export PATH="$VIRTUAL_ENV/bin:$PATH"

# Pull latest code
git pull origin main

# Reinstall (picks up new dependencies)
uv pip install -e ".[all]"

# Check for new config options
hermes config check
hermes config migrate   # Interactively add any missing options
```

### Rollback instructions

If an update introduces a problem, you can roll back to a previous version:

```bash
cd /path/to/hermes-agent

# List recent versions
git log --oneline -10

# Roll back to a specific commit
git checkout <commit-hash>
uv pip install -e ".[all]"

# Restart the gateway if running
hermes gateway restart
```

To roll back to a specific release tag (substitute your previous tag — e.g. a recent release like `v2026.5.16`, or any earlier tag from `git tag --sort=-version:refname`):

```bash
git checkout vX.Y.Z
uv pip install -e ".[all]"
```

:::warning
Rolling back may cause config incompatibilities if new options were added. Run `hermes config check` after rolling back and remove any unrecognized options from `config.yaml` if you encounter errors.
:::

### Note for Nix users

Nix is no longer an explicitly supported install path (best-effort only) — see [Nix Setup](./nix-setup.md). If you installed via Nix flake, updates are managed through the Nix package manager:

```bash
# Update the flake input
nix flake update hermes-agent

# Or rebuild with the latest
nix profile upgrade hermes-agent
```

Nix installations are immutable — rollback is handled by Nix's generation system:

```bash
nix profile rollback
```

See [Nix Setup](./nix-setup.md) for more details.

## Uninstalling

```bash
hermes uninstall
```

The uninstaller gives you the option to keep your configuration files (`~/.hermes/`) for a future reinstall.

### Manual Uninstall

```bash
rm -f ~/.local/bin/hermes
rm -rf /path/to/hermes-agent
rm -rf ~/.hermes            # Optional — keep if you plan to reinstall
```

:::info
If you installed the gateway as a system service, stop and disable it first:
```bash
hermes gateway stop
# Linux: systemctl --user disable hermes-gateway
# macOS: launchctl remove ai.hermes.gateway
```
