# x402 paid API requests

## Goal

Make HTTP requests to x402-protected endpoints. The CLI automatically detects 402 Payment Required responses, builds and signs a payment transaction with your local wallet, and retries the request with the payment proof.

## Command

```bash
mp x402 request \
  --method POST \
  --url <x402-endpoint-url> \
  --body '<json-body>' \
  --wallet <wallet-name-or-address> \
  --chain solana
```

## Available x402 endpoints

| Endpoint | Cost | Input |
|----------|------|-------|
| `https://agents.moonpay.com/x402/upgrade` | $1-$20 | `{"duration": "day"}` or `{"duration": "month"}` |

## Example flow

1. User: "Upgrade my rate limit for a day."
2. Run: `mp upgrade --duration day --wallet my-wallet --chain solana`
3. The CLI handles the 402 payment flow automatically and applies the upgrade.

## Notes

- Requires a local wallet with USDC on Solana or Base.
- Payments accepted on Solana mainnet and Base.
- If the request fails (status >= 400), the payment is not settled — you don't pay for errors.
- Use **moonpay-auth** to set up a local wallet first.
