### Task 13 — Manual Post-Verification Execution Request Planning

**Status:** ✅ Accepted (checkpointed)  
**Tests:** `uv run --extra dev pytest tests/htr/ -v`

Changes:

- `run_post_verification_execution_request_record` contract + schema validation
- `make_run_post_verification_execution_request_record`, `run_post_verification_execution_request_fingerprint`
- `derive_post_verification_execution_request_items`, `validate_post_verification_execution_request_items_correspond`
- `request_post_verification_execution()` — planning after post-verification follow-up plan exists
- Fingerprints must match on-disk result + verification + post-verification follow-up plan records
- `request_items` must correspond to post-verification follow-up plan items (or be global/manual)
- Writes `run_post_verification_execution_request_record.json`, appends `run_post_verification_execution_requested` event
- **Planning only** — no execution, no prior record mutation, no task/attempt creation
- Empty post-verification follow-up plan normally produces `empty` request; planned follow-up items may produce `requested` items
- No artifact/result/verification_result inspection

### Task 12 — Verification-Driven Follow-up Planning

**Status:** ✅ Completed (awaiting Architect review — not checkpointed)  
**Tests:** `python3 -m pytest tests/htr/ -v`

Changes:

- `run_post_verification_followup_plan_record` contract + schema validation
- `make_run_post_verification_followup_plan_record`, `run_post_verification_followup_plan_fingerprint`
- `derive_post_verification_followup_items`, `validate_post_verification_followup_items_correspond`
- `plan_post_verification_followup()` — planning after execution verification record exists
- Fingerprints must match on-disk result + verification records
- `followup_items` must correspond to execution items + item verifications
- Writes `run_post_verification_followup_plan_record.json`, appends `run_post_verification_followup_planned` event
- **Planning only** — no execution, no prior record mutation, no task/attempt creation
- Accepted verification normally produces `empty` plan; rejected/needs_changes produce `planned` items
- No artifact/result/verification_result inspection
