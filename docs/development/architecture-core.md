## AIAgent Class (run_agent.py)

The real `AIAgent.__init__` takes ~60 parameters (credentials, routing, callbacks,
session context, budget, credential pool, etc.). The signature below is the
minimum subset you'll usually touch — read `run_agent.py` for the full list.

```python
class AIAgent:
    def __init__(self,
        base_url: str = None,
        api_key: str = None,
        provider: str = None,
        api_mode: str = None,              # "chat_completions" | "codex_responses" | ...
        model: str = "",                   # empty → resolved from config/provider later
        max_iterations: int = 90,          # per-agent tool-calling iteration cap
        enabled_toolsets: list = None,
        disabled_toolsets: list = None,
        quiet_mode: bool = False,
        save_trajectories: bool = False,
        platform: str = None,              # "cli", "telegram", etc.
        session_id: str = None,
        skip_context_files: bool = False,
        skip_memory: bool = False,
        credential_pool=None,
        # ... plus callbacks, thread/user/chat IDs, iteration_budget, fallback_model,
        # checkpoints config, prefill_messages, service_tier, reasoning_config, etc.
    ): ...

    def chat(self, message: str) -> str:
        """Simple interface — returns final response string."""

    def run_conversation(self, user_message: str, system_message: str = None,
                         conversation_history: list = None, task_id: str = None) -> dict:
        """Full interface — returns dict with final_response + messages."""
```

### Agent Loop

The core loop is inside `run_conversation()` — entirely synchronous, with
interrupt checks, budget tracking, and a one-turn grace call:

```python
while (api_call_count < self.max_iterations and self.iteration_budget.remaining > 0) \
        or self._budget_grace_call:
    if self._interrupt_requested: break
    response = client.chat.completions.create(model=model, messages=messages, tools=tool_schemas)
    if response.tool_calls:
        for tool_call in response.tool_calls:
            result = handle_function_call(tool_call.name, tool_call.args, task_id)
            messages.append(tool_result_message(result))
        api_call_count += 1
    else:
        return response.content
```

Messages follow OpenAI format: `{"role": "system/user/assistant/tool", ...}`.
Reasoning content is stored in `assistant_msg["reasoning"]`.

## Tool discovery and exposure

`tools/registry.py` is dependency-light and imported by tool modules. Built-in
tool modules under `tools/` register at import time; `model_tools.py` triggers discovery
and resolves schemas/dispatch before `run_agent.py`, `cli.py`, `batch_runner.py`,
and environment consumers use them. Registration alone does not expose a tool:
the root contract in `AGENTS.md` governs toolset exposure.

## CLI Architecture (cli.py)

- **Rich** for banner/panels, **prompt_toolkit** for input with autocomplete
- **KawaiiSpinner** (`agent/display.py`) — animated faces during API calls, `┊` activity feed for tool results
- `load_cli_config()` in cli.py merges hardcoded defaults + user config YAML
- **Skin engine** (`hermes_cli/skin_engine.py`) — data-driven CLI theming; initialized from `display.skin` config key at startup; skins customize banner colors, spinner faces/verbs/wings, tool prefix, response box, branding text
- `process_command()` is a method on `HermesCLI` — dispatches on canonical command name resolved via `resolve_command()` from the central registry
- Skill slash commands: `agent/skill_commands.py` scans `~/.hermes/skills/`, injects as **user message** (not system prompt) to preserve prompt caching

### Slash Command Registry (`hermes_cli/commands.py`)

All slash commands are defined in a central `COMMAND_REGISTRY` list of `CommandDef` objects. Every downstream consumer derives from this registry automatically:

- **CLI** — `process_command()` resolves aliases via `resolve_command()`, dispatches on canonical name
- **Gateway** — `GATEWAY_KNOWN_COMMANDS` frozenset for hook emission, `resolve_command()` for dispatch
- **Gateway help** — `gateway_help_lines()` generates `/help` output
- **Telegram** — `telegram_bot_commands()` generates the BotCommand menu
- **Slack** — `slack_subcommand_map()` generates `/hermes` subcommand routing
- **Autocomplete** — `COMMANDS` flat dict feeds `SlashCommandCompleter`
- **CLI help** — `COMMANDS_BY_CATEGORY` dict feeds `show_help()`

### Adding a Slash Command

1. Add a `CommandDef` entry to `COMMAND_REGISTRY` in `hermes_cli/commands.py`:
```python
CommandDef("mycommand", "Description of what it does", "Session",
           aliases=("mc",), args_hint="[arg]"),
```
2. Add handler in `HermesCLI.process_command()` in `cli.py`:
```python
elif canonical == "mycommand":
    self._handle_mycommand(cmd_original)
```
3. If the command is available in the gateway, add a handler in `gateway/run.py`:
```python
if canonical == "mycommand":
    return await self._handle_mycommand(event)
```
4. For persistent settings, use `save_config_value()` in `cli.py`

**CommandDef fields:**
- `name` — canonical name without slash (e.g. `"background"`)
- `description` — human-readable description
- `category` — one of `"Session"`, `"Configuration"`, `"Tools & Skills"`, `"Info"`, `"Exit"`
- `aliases` — tuple of alternative names (e.g. `("bg",)`)
- `args_hint` — argument placeholder shown in help (e.g. `"<prompt>"`, `"[name]"`)
- `cli_only` — only available in the interactive CLI
- `gateway_only` — only available in messaging platforms
- `gateway_config_gate` — config dotpath (e.g. `"display.tool_progress_command"`); when set on a `cli_only` command, the command becomes available in the gateway if the config value is truthy. `GATEWAY_KNOWN_COMMANDS` always includes config-gated commands so the gateway can dispatch them; help/menus only show them when the gate is open.

**Adding an alias** requires only adding it to the `aliases` tuple on the existing `CommandDef`. No other file changes needed — dispatch, help text, Telegram menu, Slack mapping, and autocomplete all update automatically.

## Delegation (`delegate_task`)

`tools/delegate_tool.py` spawns isolated child conversations with their own
terminal sessions and toolsets. Top-level model calls normally dispatch in the
background and return immediately; the completed single result or consolidated
batch re-enters the parent conversation. Finite/non-routable sessions and
rejected or capacity-limited dispatches fall back to synchronous execution.
Do not poll. Direct Python callers retain the historical synchronous default,
and orchestrator children run synchronously so their own turn can consume
worker results.

- Use `goal` for one child or `tasks` for parallel fan-out. Concurrency is
  bounded by `delegation.max_concurrent_children`.
- `leaf` children retain `execute_code` but cannot call `delegate_task`,
  `clarify`, `memory`, `send_message`, or `cronjob`. Orchestrators regain only
  `delegate_task`, and only when `delegation.orchestrator_enabled` and
  `max_spawn_depth` allow it.
- Children know none of the parent conversation; pass every requirement in
  `context`. Their final summaries are self-reports, so verify paths, URLs, IDs,
  or other external side effects before claiming success.
- Delegation is not durable: `/stop`, `/new`, or process exit cancels in-flight
  children. Use cron or tracked terminal background work for tasks that must
  survive the session.

The model-facing `background` parameter is retained only for compatibility and
is ignored. Dynamic schema descriptions in `get_definitions()` expose the
user's actual concurrency and nesting limits.

Delegation controls live under `delegation`: `max_concurrent_children`,
`max_spawn_depth`, `child_timeout_seconds`, `orchestrator_enabled`,
`subagent_auto_approve`, `inherit_mcp_toolsets`, and the per-child independent
`max_iterations`. A non-positive child timeout disables the wall-clock cap.
`subagent_auto_approve` removes human review from dangerous child commands; keep
it disabled unless that non-interactive trust boundary is intentional.
