"""SQLite-backed Kanban board for multi-profile, multi-project collaboration.

In a fresh install the board lives at ``<root>/kanban.db`` where
``<root>`` is the **shared Hermes root** (the parent of any active
profile). Profiles intentionally collapse onto a shared board: it IS
the cross-profile coordination primitive. A worker spawned with
``hermes -p <profile>`` joins the same board as the dispatcher that
claimed the task. The same applies to ``<root>/kanban/workspaces/`` and
``<root>/kanban/logs/``.

**Multiple boards (projects):** users can create additional boards to
separate unrelated streams of work (e.g. one per project / repo / domain).
Each board is a directory under ``<root>/kanban/boards/<slug>/`` with
its own ``kanban.db``, ``workspaces/``, and ``logs/``. All boards share
the profile's Hermes home but are otherwise isolated: a worker spawned
for a task on board ``atm10-server`` sees only that board's tasks,
cannot enumerate other boards, and its dispatcher ticks don't touch
other boards' DBs.

The first (and for single-project users, only) board is ``default``.
For back-compat its on-disk DB is ``<root>/kanban.db`` (not
``boards/default/kanban.db``), so installs that predate the boards
feature keep working with zero migration. See :func:`kanban_db_path`.

Board resolution order (highest precedence first, all optional):

* ``board=`` argument passed directly to :func:`connect` / :func:`init_db`
  (explicit — used by the CLI ``--board`` flag and the dashboard
  ``?board=...`` query param).
* ``HERMES_KANBAN_BOARD`` env var (used by the dispatcher to pin workers
  to the board their task lives on — workers cannot see other boards).
* ``HERMES_KANBAN_DB`` env var (pins the DB file path directly — legacy
  override still honoured; highest precedence when the file path itself
  is what the caller wants to force).
* ``<root>/kanban/current`` — a one-line text file holding the slug of
  the "currently selected" board. Written by ``hermes kanban boards
  switch <slug>``. When absent, the active board is ``default``.

In standard installs ``<root>`` is ``~/.hermes``. In Docker / custom
deployments where ``HERMES_HOME`` points outside ``~/.hermes`` (e.g.
``/opt/hermes``), ``<root>`` is ``HERMES_HOME``. Legacy env-var
overrides still work:

* ``HERMES_KANBAN_DB`` — pin the database file path directly.
* ``HERMES_KANBAN_WORKSPACES_ROOT`` — pin the workspaces root directly.
* ``HERMES_KANBAN_HOME`` — pin the umbrella root that anchors kanban
  paths. Useful for tests and unusual deployments.

The dispatcher injects ``HERMES_KANBAN_DB``,
``HERMES_KANBAN_WORKSPACES_ROOT``, and ``HERMES_KANBAN_BOARD`` into
worker subprocess env so workers converge on the exact DB the
dispatcher used to claim their task — even under unusual symlink or
Docker layouts.

Schema is intentionally small: tasks, task_links, task_comments,
task_events.  The ``workspace_kind`` field decouples coordination from git
worktrees so that research / ops / digital-twin workloads work alongside
coding workloads.  See ``docs/hermes-kanban-v1-spec.pdf`` for the full
design specification.

Concurrency strategy: WAL mode + ``BEGIN IMMEDIATE`` for write
transactions + compare-and-swap (CAS) updates on ``tasks.status`` and
``tasks.claim_lock``.  SQLite serializes writers via its WAL lock, so at
most one claimer can win any given task.  Losers observe zero affected
rows and move on -- no retry loops, no distributed-lock machinery.
The CAS coordination is **per-board** — each board is a separate DB,
so multi-board installs get the same atomicity guarantees without any
new locking.

    """Non-blocking single-writer guard around one dispatcher tick.

    Yields ``True`` when this process holds the board's dispatch lock and
    may proceed with the tick, or ``False`` when another process already
    holds it (the caller should skip the tick this round).

    Motivation (issue #35240): a ``hermes gateway run --replace`` /
    ``gateway restart`` invoked from a shell on a systemd/launchd host can
    leave an orphan gateway whose dispatcher escapes the service cgroup,
    survives ``systemctl restart``, and becomes a *second* long-lived
    writer on the same ``kanban.db``. Two dispatchers that each believe
    they own the file both pass SQLite ``busy_timeout`` and then race on
    WAL frames — the documented root cause of multi-writer corruption.
    The startup guard (``_guard_supervised_gateway_conflict``) blocks the
    common way an orphan is born, but this lock is the defense-in-depth
    that prevents two dispatchers from ever writing concurrently
    *regardless of how the second one got there*.

    The lock is **non-blocking** on purpose: the gateway's async watcher
    must never stall on a held lock. A losing dispatcher simply skips its
    tick (the winner is making progress on the same board), and tries
    again next interval.

    Board-scoped: the lock file is a ``.dispatch.lock`` sibling of the
    board's ``kanban.db``, so unrelated boards tick independently. On
    platforms without ``fcntl``/``msvcrt`` the guard degrades to a no-op
    (yields ``True``) — single-writer enforcement is best-effort and the
    orphan-dispatcher scenario is specific to POSIX service managers.

    failures the task is auto-blocked with the last error as its reason —
    prevents the dispatcher from thrashing forever on an unfixable task.

    it counts tasks already in ``status='running'`` plus this tick's spawns
    against the limit. So ``max_spawn=4`` means "at most 4 workers running
    at any time across the whole board" — matching the gateway's stated
    intent ("limit concurrent kanban tasks"). With a per-tick interpretation
    a 60-second tick interval could grow concurrency by N every minute on a
    busy board and accumulate without bound.

    ``max_in_progress`` is a **host-level** concurrency cap (OOF-30): it
    counts running tasks on every active board — not just this one — plus
    this tick's spawns. Workers are OS processes sharing one machine's
    memory, so a per-board interpretation would multiply the cap by the
    number of active boards. ``max_spawn`` retains its historical per-board
    semantics.

    ``spawn_fn`` defaults to ``_default_spawn``. Tests pass a stub.
    ``board`` pins workspace/log/db resolution for this tick to a specific
    board. When omitted, the current-board resolution chain is used.

    # ---- review column dispatch ----
    # Review tasks are tasks that a worker moved to 'review' after
    # creating a PR.  The dispatcher spawns a review agent (loading
    # sdlc-review skill) that verifies the candidate and either approves
    # (→ done) or requests changes (→ ready/todo for the implementer).
    #
    # Same concurrency model as ready dispatch: review spawns count
    # against max_spawn alongside ready tasks, so the total number of
    # running workers stays bounded.
    # Auto-dispatch is enabled by default because Hermes bundles the
    # ``sdlc-review`` skill and reviewer workers can now approve, request
    # changes without block-loop accounting, or escalate a genuine blocker.
    # Human-only boards can disable it with ``kanban.review_dispatch``.
    #
    # ``review_rows`` was enumerated before the ready loop; when it is
    # non-empty the ready loop ran against ``ready_budget`` (one slot held
    # back) so this lane cannot be permanently starved by a sustained
    # ready backlog. The review loop itself still checks the FULL shared
    # ``spawn_budget`` — the reservation caps the ready lane, it does not
    # grant the review lane extra capacity.

    replay must reproduce it so the woken turn's ``build_session_key`` matches
    the original event's — ``build_session_key`` prefers ``user_id_alt`` over
    ``user_id`` (gateway/session.py), so replaying only ``user_id`` would key a
    wake into a different session whenever the two diverge for this source.

    ``chat_type`` records the originating source's chat type; the active-wake
    delivery modes replay it so the woken turn resolves the operator's real
    channel. ``None`` keeps an existing row's value.

    ``delivery_mode`` (see ``_NOTIFY_DELIVERY_MODES``) selects how the
    kanban-notifier reacts to a terminal event for this subscription. ``None``
    leaves an existing row's mode untouched (and inserts the ``"notify"``
    default for a fresh row); an explicit value is last-write-wins, so an
    operator can intentionally re-subscribe to change the mode (e.g.
    ``notify`` -> ``wake``). An unknown value falls back to ``"notify"``.
    New subscriptions start "caught up": ``last_event_id`` snaps to the
    task's current ``MAX(task_events.id)`` at creation instead of the
    schema default 0. A cursor of 0 on an already-active task made the
    gateway notifier replay every historical terminal event on its next
    tick — and with many stale subs, a single boot-time burst of 100+
    messages (issue #29905). Subscribers only want events that occur
